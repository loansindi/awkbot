[10:21:49] <NegativeK> (I assume you're talking about the computers.)
[10:22:02] <`justin> it is "valid"
[10:22:08] <`justin> the 555 is a bit cheaper
[10:22:23] <`justin> but that doesn't mean it's better
[10:22:29] <bjonnh> I can find some attiny 13a for $0.55 (by 10), a 555 can be found for $0.05
[10:22:45] <bjonnh> now how long does it take to solder 4 components instead of 1
[10:22:47] <`justin> bjonnh: that seems right
[10:22:59] <NegativeK> s/solder/twist
[10:23:02] <`justin> we did not have people soldering
[10:23:09] <`justin> we had them twist leads together

[10:23:15] <hef> NegativeK: that looks likely
[10:23:23] <loans> bjonnh : I used the ATTiny45 which is about $1 in those quantities. a 555 drops down to like $.50

[10:23:40] <loans> dunno about a low voltage one, though

[10:26:09] <bjonnh> 555 or any astable or a microcontroller
[10:26:21] <loans> sylphiae: if you mean printing I dint recommend using our printers - even if your filament is safe, the machine definitely is not
[10:26:22] <bjonnh> and it was more easy to have a reliable blinking with a microcontroller
[10:26:37] <bjonnh> and now it's programmable by serial port, I have gradients of frequenciesâ€¦
[10:26:44] <sylphiae> :-/ 
[10:26:48] <NegativeK> Frankly, the microcontroller makes more sense just from the reusability standpoint.
[10:26:49] <bjonnh> so microcontroller wins ;)
[10:27:03] <NegativeK> Even if one person from 100 reprograms it, it's worth more than a 555.
[10:28:55] <sylphiae> i wonder if it's worth it to set up a food grade ABS only 3D printer

[10:30:20] <sylphiae> like if it's set up
[10:30:27] <sylphiae> will people just make it non food grade pretty quickly ? 
[10:30:28] <bjonnh> doesn't abs make nasty stuff when heated ?

[10:34:46] <sylphiae> well, if you look further down
[10:34:52] <sylphiae> people actually looked at printed thingys with a microscope

[10:37:08] <loans> could be routable if you did it in pieces
[10:37:41] <sylphiae> :-/ 
[10:37:46] <bjonnh> but however I think that bad quality honey found almost everywhere could be more nasty that some leaking styrene

[10:43:22] <sylphiae> i figured you can just seal the printed object somehow
[10:43:26] <bjonnh> I wonder if there is a way to use the fast moving commands of vi occasionnaly in emacs
[10:43:27] <NegativeK> I've tried to do Java in vi.
[10:43:30] <NegativeK> It was a mistake.
[10:43:46] <bjonnh> I tried to do java in eclipse
[10:43:49] <bjonnh> it was a mistake.
[10:44:01] <bjonnh> I tried to do javaâ€¦

[10:44:46] <tac-tics> Naw. My network speed is unbeatable.
[10:44:48] <tac-tics> The problem is
[10:44:52] <tac-tics> my irc client is written in Java
[10:45:58] <bjonnh> no that's not true. I'm 12 machines from my server which is 6 machines from the freenode server I useâ€¦ so 18â€¦

[11:00:59] <bjonnh> why isn't there a git merge for word documents
[11:01:02] <bjonnh> really
[11:01:42] <loans> because they're a binary format?
[11:01:48] <bjonnh> YEAH
[11:01:50] <bjonnh> IÂ KNOW
[11:01:58] <bjonnh> but why
[11:02:01] <bjonnh> whyyyyyy
[11:02:03] <sylphiae> o.o
[11:02:17] <bjonnh> two of us worked on the same document, made a lot of changes
[11:02:36] <bjonnh> I'm tempted to export it to txt and run a diff
[11:02:37] <sylphiae> i just used google docs 
[11:02:37] <Bioguy> \w/ \w/
[11:02:52] <bjonnh> I don't trust google docs
[11:02:57] <sylphiae> hah
[11:03:00] <bjonnh> and we need to work offline too
[11:03:02] <loans> but you trust word
[11:03:14] <bjonnh> unfortunately they want to use that
[11:03:24] <sylphiae> i remember skay posted something like github but for documents once
[11:03:41] <bjonnh> and also the other author did not track changes
[11:04:16] <`justin> bjonnh: the newer versions of word do have a merge function
[11:04:29] <`justin> not that you can use it from git
[11:04:33] <`justin> but you can use it in word
[11:05:28] <`justin> Review Tab -> Compare -> Combine
[11:05:36] <`justin> i've never used it before though

[11:06:48] <bry> but elizabeth is on the wait list
[11:06:50] <bry> so that means
[11:07:07] <bry> I'm not actually doing it for me. I'm #4 on the wait list
[11:07:26] <bry> But elizabeth is officially on the wait list, so she needs to take it anyways
[11:07:43] <`justin> ah
[11:07:47] <`justin> i see
[11:07:52] <bry> Next time, someone just make me their +1 if you don't see me on the list >.>
[11:07:56] <`justin> i thought she was already on the class list
[11:07:59] <bry> I will reward you with cupcakes

[11:19:23] <skay> it's like the six degrees of kevin bacon thing, but for academics
[11:19:32] <bjonnh> so erdos numbers will tend to infinity over time ?
[11:19:39] <skay> bjonnh: no, they are finite

[11:42:17] <bjonnh> Â« Ironically, without net neutrality, I imagine the FCC's website would be in the slow-lane and we wouldn't all be able to stream this at the same time. Just sayin'. Â»
[11:42:17] <skay> so then I remembered their names since then and noticed he had a book on embodied cognition
[11:42:24] <bjonnh> I love this comment from slashdot
[11:42:28] <sylphiae> i've barely done any work today O.o 
[11:43:02] <bjonnh> sylphiae: same
[11:43:05] <bjonnh> :s
[11:43:21] <sylphiae> so does anyone have recommendations for a good first 3D printer? 
[11:44:44] <ScribbleJ> sylphiae, the MendelMax designs are good, The Prusa v3 is not bad.  The seemecnc designs are OK, but get a big plus in that you can drive out there and get personal help if need be.
[11:44:44] <asl2> ask aeva?
[11:45:05] <ScribbleJ> They're right next door in Indiana.
[11:45:19] <sylphiae> O.o 
[11:45:54] <sylphiae> thanks ScribbleJ
[11:53:37] <sylphiae> ooh, I like the Orion Delta
[11:53:55] <sylphiae> it's like 1400 OEM though > .< 
[11:54:35] <ScribbleJ> Jon Oly from SeeMeCNC has done a lot of work with the space.  If you contact him, maaaybe he'll offer you a PumpingStationOne discount.
[11:54:39] <ScribbleJ> He's a relaly nice guy.
[11:54:42] <ScribbleJ> really
[11:55:30] <ScribbleJ> If you want to save cash, though, a Prusa i3 kit is probably your best bet, you can find decent ones for maybe $500-ish.
[11:56:05] <ScribbleJ> Delta designs are a lot of fun but cartesian designs are generally a better choice for a first go.
[11:56:23] <ScribbleJ> On the other hand... SeeMeCNC is very helpful and accessable to get you going.
[11:56:54] <sylphiae> nods
[11:58:10] <ScribbleJ> You can get an overabundance of possibly-confusing advice in #reprap if you like.
[11:58:23] <ScribbleJ> There's also #seemecnc for them, specifically.
[11:58:38] <ScribbleJ> I think there's also a #makerstoolworks for the mendelmax guys.  Not sure.
[11:59:37] <sylphiae> yeah, I was gonna check some related channels out when I wasn't at work

[12:09:12] <aeva> asl2 I'm kind of a biased party
[12:09:38] <aeva> sylphiae are you interested in building one from a kit or having something that works right away?  (and how much money are you willing to spend on it?)
[12:09:53] <Bioguy> I only trust the Mayday Mystery website for my socio-economic information.
[12:09:59] <Bioguy> And of course, the Time Cube website.
[12:10:24] <sylphiae> a kit, since it'll probably be cheaper
[12:10:38] <sylphiae> well, i was hoping it would be less than 1400 bucks
[12:10:44] <sylphiae> i guess i'm willing to spend 500
[12:11:03] <sylphiae> up to 1000

[12:27:15] <aeva> cool
[12:27:25] <aeva> I've been planning on doing some classes on that topic
[12:27:46] <loans> I'd go to a blender class
[12:27:51] <Bioguy> Blender or 3-D in general?  Need inpsiration.
[12:27:59] <Bioguy> Blender ok
[12:28:04] <sylphiae> me 3? 
[12:28:46] <sylphiae> i should go to lunch but i'm too pissed off about american politics heh
[12:29:01] * Bioguy laughs out loud.
[12:29:12] <Bioguy> There was a point in my life where a lot of politics got me down.
[12:29:14] <sylphiae> if I ever write a history book it will be named: The conservative turn in American politics in the late 20th century and how it fucked is over in the early 21st
[12:29:27] <aeva> blender 3d :)
[12:29:28] <sylphiae> us* 
[12:29:40] <NegativeK> CarlFK: Thinking about First Slice? I might be able to leave here around 2:00.
[12:30:26] <aeva> a bunch of people have asked me to do a class...
[12:30:57] <aeva> so some topics I'd probbaly cover are 1) the basics, 2) sculpt mode, 3) copying objects with a calipers, 4) preparing things for printing
[12:31:06] <sylphiae> neat, aeva
[12:31:12] <NegativeK> I'd attend!
[12:31:19] <Bioguy> Aeva: JFDI
[12:31:29] <NegativeK> Please DI.
[12:31:48] <aeva> Bioguy: I'm not waiting on permission or anything - I need to plan it out first, and I haven't had time
[12:31:51] <sylphiae> the problem with the way the american government is set up is twofold: since our election system is first past the post, plurality wins, and no follow up elections or coatlion government
[12:31:59] <sylphiae> this results in a two party system
[12:32:04] <sylphiae> coalition* 
[12:32:10] <sylphiae> secondly, even though we have separation of powers
[12:32:27] <sylphiae> since the president appoints the SC justices, federal justices, and independent commissioners like the FCC
[12:32:30] *** Quits: Chadwell (~Adium@50-196-240-145-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[12:32:44] <sylphiae> if one party gets presidents elected too often, the judiciary will skew 
[12:33:06] <t_j> http://dearfcc.org (as fcc was bought up)
[12:33:31] <sylphiae> and as politics moves steadily to the right, the other party balances by also moving to the right
[12:33:41] <Bioguy> That's why they should have kept the old system of states' governors being able to appoint senators.
[12:33:41] <sylphiae> hence weak centrist liberals like Clinton and obama
[12:33:49] <sylphiae> instead of real progressives
[12:34:20] <Bioguy> We need the 50million disorganized parties like in other countries so parties need to form coalition governments to get things done.
[12:34:39] <sylphiae> we also have a broken 4th estate
[12:34:43] <sylphiae> the media is pretty damn useless
[12:35:21] <sylphiae> well, i guess it varies if coalition governments actually get more done than a two party gridlocked system
[12:35:24] <Bioguy> well, it's all pay to play.  In order to get access, you need to cosy up to them.  Look at the whole Chicago-CNN-Chicagoland contraversy
[12:35:48] <sylphiae> I mean their focus is all wrong
[12:35:50] <Bioguy> coalition governments foster broad platforms
[12:36:01] <sylphiae> they do, and they allow smaller parties a voice
[12:36:09] <sylphiae> which can be good or bad, depending on the parties that arise
[12:36:16] <Bioguy> Pirate Party.
[12:36:25] <sylphiae> we could have potentially Tea Party-GOP-Democrat coalition
[12:36:25] <Bioguy> in germany
[12:36:25] <sylphiae> shudder
[12:36:46] <Bioguy> Tea Party - GOP - Democrat to some extant already exists.
[12:36:59] <sylphiae> yeah, so maybe it would make no difference
[12:37:13] <t_j> humm lets see how that goes down
[12:37:21] <CarlFK> NegativeK: First slice NOW HURRY! HUNGRY!!!
[12:37:21] <sylphiae> i hate to say this, but we really need an interim dictator
[12:37:34] <NegativeK> CarlFK: Go without me! Save yourself!
[12:37:34] <sylphiae> which is a contradiction in terms
[12:37:36] * t_j guesses like a tonne of bricks made of manure
[12:37:43] <loans> oh boy poloticsssss
[12:37:47] <NegativeK> I've an hourish of meeting starting at 1:00.
[12:37:47] <sylphiae> if democracy gets too gridlocked, it should alternate with authoritarianism
[12:37:48] <loans> polotic
[12:37:50] <CarlFK> sylphiae: are you close?  want lunch?  
[12:37:57] <sylphiae> CarlFK: in northbrook
[12:38:13] <asl2> how many member points do you get if you're appointed dictator and steer resources to ps/1?
[12:38:17] <CarlFK> gah.  Why are you way over there.  you want a house in Niles?
[12:38:21] <sylphiae> heh
[12:38:26] <sylphiae> how close is Niles to the city? 
[12:38:41] <CarlFK> it borders Chicago, next to Skokie 
[12:38:54] <t_j> asl2: all of them if you get all of the resources otherwise none
[12:38:59] <sylphiae> are you selling a house?? 
[12:39:02] <CarlFK> I think it is a mile from the Motrn Grove Metra stop 
[12:39:18] <sylphiae> does it have L access? 
[12:39:18] <CarlFK> kinda.  I want to, but haven't formally started 
[12:39:48] <CarlFK> there is the end of the Yellow line in Skokie.  but it isn't really close, and it has a pretty lame schedule 
[12:39:59] <CarlFK> like doesn't run on Sunday at all or something dumb 
[12:40:25] <sylphiae> what are property values in the area? 
[12:41:35] <sylphiae> i doubt i qualify for a mortgage, but my parents can be persuaded to buy
[12:41:38] <NegativeK> CarlFK: No promises about 2:00.
[12:42:03] <sylphiae> they hold too many crappy properties in SW neighborhoods
[12:42:30] <CarlFK> sylphiae: across the street a house just sold for $200k  - exact same sized lot, slightly smaller house, similar condition 
[12:42:56] <CarlFK> zolo or whatever says my place is $245k
[12:43:04] <sylphiae> zillow
[12:43:08] <CarlFK> yeah, that
[12:43:14] <NegativeK> Yolo.
[12:43:44] <sylphiae> when you say similar condition, is it a fixer upper? 
[12:45:33] <CarlFK> maybe, depending on what you mean by that.  it is on the lower side of "sucks --- nice" but not at all complete crap
[12:46:11] <NegativeK> !8ball Carl's house?
[12:46:12] <brybot> Very doubtful, assface.
[12:46:15] <CarlFK> lol
[12:46:49] <CarlFK> I 1/2 expect someone will replace the nice little house with a huge mansion 
[12:47:20] <CarlFK> that is what was happening on the street back before the market whet kaboom
[12:48:00] <sylphiae> honestly, i'm looking for something that's both rentable and Airbnb-able
[12:48:12] <sylphiae> niles might be too far for Airbnb

[12:53:01] <`justin> thanks
[12:53:13] <`justin> there's a very slim chance that i will be at the space later to do it myself
[12:53:19] <CarlFK> Airbnb ... to far from public transpo 
[12:53:21] <`justin> but it's unlikely i'll have time
[12:53:31] <sylphiae> yeah:-/ 
[12:53:33] <`justin> so i figured i'd try to get someone else to do it
[12:53:36] <sylphiae> also that area looks like it's zoned for single family homes

[13:53:09] <Bioguy> yaaaay
[13:53:17] <Bioguy> what projects you got?
[13:53:38] <sylphiae> i have a list of space related projects only on google docs, if you want to see
[13:53:49] <sylphiae> and two websites
[13:53:55] <sylphiae> to build
[13:54:20] <sylphiae> i also wanted to do a version of Greg's emergence project but with chatbots only:-/ 
[13:55:23] <sylphiae> the websites are for businesses; one for a comission, and the other for myself
[13:55:43] <bjonnh> I should add a !foodporn to my bot

[14:05:02] <`Nerobro> cool!
[14:05:11] <`Nerobro> well, a model name would be enough :-)
[14:05:16] <sylphiae> he made up the design himself
[14:05:23] <sylphiae> i'm not sure there is a model name attached
[14:05:27] <`Nerobro> aah
[14:05:40] <sylphiae> i can show you a picture sometime
[14:05:52] <sylphiae> maybe you can tell if he based the original design on a model?

[14:36:12] <`Nerobro> NegativeK, the only problem with that graph, is it assumes little or no tension on the wheel.

[14:47:44] <`justin> `Nerobro: spokes don't "hang" your bike so much
[14:48:04] <`justin> most of the force is transmitted through the bottom spokes to hold up your bike
[14:48:24] <`justin> they are pretensioned so that they don't break/bend when you apply the force
[14:48:51] <`justin> if you see in that picture
[14:49:10] <`justin> the spokes in the top are at basically normal spoke tension
[14:49:20] <`justin> and the ones at the bottom have close to no tension
[14:49:33] <`justin> because of the force of the rider's weight
